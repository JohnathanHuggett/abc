# Approach
1. Initial Setup:
    - Began by establishing all global styles, helpers, and utilities.
    - Created a rudimentary test case to ensure everything was set up correctly.
2. Page Layouts:
    - Developed a base layout for each page.
3. Component Development:
    - Planned to build each page by creating the necessary components and completing the entire page.
4. Form Implementation:
    - Focused on the main form, ensuring validations were functional.
    - Added unstyled inputs, labels, and error messages.
    - Prioritized getting the form to work completely before styling components to match the Figma design.
5. Progress:
    - Did not fully complete the form section.
6. Testing:
    - Planned to revisit all pages and components to thoroughly test them after completing the initial build.

# Getting Started 

### `npm install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
